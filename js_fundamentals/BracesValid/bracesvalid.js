// Given a string, write a function that will determine whether the braces  - including parentheses (), square brackets [], and curly brackets {} - within the string are valid. That means that any braces within other braces must close before the outer set closes.

// HINT: Keep in mind that you may use arrays and objects to keep your information organized!

// Example: bracesValid("{{()}}[]") returns true because the inner braces close before the outer braces. Each opening brace has a matching closing brace.

// Example:  bracesValid("{(})") returns false because the curly braces close before the parentheses, which starts within the curly braces, had a chance to close.
